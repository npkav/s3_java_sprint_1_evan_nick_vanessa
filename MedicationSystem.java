// · Edit and delete medications, patients, and doctors
// · Generate a report containing all system data, including drugs, patients, doctors, and prescriptions
// · Check for expired medications and display a message if any are found.
// · Print a list of all prescription’s issued by a specific doctor.
// · Restock the drugs in the pharmacy in some capacity. You can just add a random number to the stock, you can add a specific number. Its up to you!
